chapter 1 ===> 1.5 Getting started installing git ====> install git from tarball on a separate vm machine later on


in 1.6 Getting Started - First-Time Git Setup
don't understand that part 

Note
Since Git might read the same configuration variable value from more than one file, it’s possible that you have an unexpected value for one of these values and you don’t know why. In cases like that, you can query Git as to the origin for that value, and it will tell you which configuration file had the final say in setting that value:

$ git config --show-origin rerere.autoUpdate
file:/home/johndoe/.gitconfig	false

see how use freenode for chat and ask people which is in section 1.7
